# Survey form with React
This is a project created during the Technigo Bootcamp. The assignment was to practise React state and controlled forms by building a survey form.

## The problem
I started off by creating a parent component called Survey and several child components containing different input types as well as a welcome component and a summary component. I then focused on learning and implementing Logical && Operator to show either the form or the summary depending on if the form was completed or not. I had some issues adding validation to the form but managed to get it working with help from others and by testing different approaches.
I styled the survey to in some extend look like Typeform but also wanted to add some styling to give it a little bit of "Game Of Thrones"-winter feeling.

If I had more time I would have tried to add checkboxes to the survey.
